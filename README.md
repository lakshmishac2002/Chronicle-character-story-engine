 How to Use

1. **Launch the application** (open .jsx file in Claude artifact)
2. **Click "Create Your First Character"**

4. **First scene auto-generates** based on character
5. **Use natural language to edit:**
   - "Make her smile"
   - "The room is now dimly lit"
   - "She's tired and worried"
6. **Watch timeline grow** as scenes evolve
7. **Try invalid edits** to see rejection system:
   - "Change her eye color" 
   - "Make her act recklessly" 


Conclusion

Chronicle reimagines AI-powered creative tools as **story engines with memory**, not stateless prompt playgrounds. By enforcing character consistency, enabling natural language editing, and visualizing scene evolution, it demonstrates a path toward more intentional, narrative-driven AI creativity.

**This is a system, not a toy.**

**Chronicle** - Where characters persist, scenes evolve, and stories remember.
